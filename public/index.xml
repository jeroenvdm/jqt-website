It&amp;rsquo;s such a long way from here.&#xA;I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</description>

      <description>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There’ll be no one to stop us this time!</description>
