      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is a lot of discussion about building software with AI. This changes the dynamics within development teams and therefore also the dynamics between the product owner and the developers. To gain experience and have a good time at the same time, I will specify a back-end application in the upcoming articles with the help of AI. The focus here is on developing a specification that is independent of the technology and aligns as well as possible with the coding process with AI. The focus of these articles is therefore on the relationship between the product owner and the development team, not between the product owner and external stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
