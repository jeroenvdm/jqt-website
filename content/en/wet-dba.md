Since January 1, 2025, the DBA (Deregulation of Labor Relations Assessment Act) is actively enforced by the Dutch tax authorities. This law has existed since 2016 but was not monitored until 2025. The following aspects ensure that hiring me from JQT Consultancy BV is not problematic:

1. **JQT Consultancy BV**: You can hire me for assignments through JQT Consultancy BV, which has multiple clients for both software services and IT consultancy work.
2. **Contract**: I will send you an agreement for the assignment from JQT Consultancy BV with our own general terms and conditions, specifically designed to ensure successful collaboration.
3. **Own business resources**: I bring my own MacBook with the usual software, so I can get started quickly and provide value to the client. Only company-specific software from the contractor will need to be arranged by the contractor.
4. **Entrepreneurial behavior**: This website, business cards, etc., ensure that I operate as an entrepreneur.
5. **Invoices**: I will invoice monthly or per assignment from JQT Consultancy BV.
6. **Knowledge**: I often bring knowledge that has not yet been applied, or is applied to a limited extent, at the client. This ensures that knowledge sharing is part of the assignment.
7. **Insurance**: JQT Consultancy BV has professional liability and general liability insurance. Additionally, matters such as health insurance and disability insurance are arranged for me personally.

I hope this has addressed any concerns, and I look forward to a pleasant collaboration.
