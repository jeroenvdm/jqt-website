title: "Product Management with Claude Code"
description: "Not only is application development changing rapidly with the rise of AI, product management is evolving just as quickly. In this article, I develop a prototype application with Claude Code that I can test and optimize with stakeholders."

Where we as product owners used to create mock-ups with Figma or other tools, we now have AI coding tools available to create prototypes of features and solutions. Together with stakeholders, we can iterate faster on the desired functionality and deliver a more complete set of specifications to the development team. In this article, I set myself the goal of creating a working prototype based on specifications together with Claude Code. I will host this prototype on fly.io so I can share the URL with stakeholders, discuss it, and receive valuable feedback.

In this way, I quickly get an understanding of what should and shouldn't be possible, so the development team doesn't have to make unnecessary changes. Additionally, Claude Code will create detailed feature descriptions including the necessary tests that I can validate and give to the dev team, so they can incorporate this for the final production implementation.

A second function of the prototype is to discuss the feasibility and cost-benefit analysis of the final version together with the dev team, so that complexity and risks are quickly identified and possibly limited. This leads to better promises to the business and is motivating for the dev team.
