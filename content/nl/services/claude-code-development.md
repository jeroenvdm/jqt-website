Suppose your organisation is not using AI for software development. You feel the pressure to start using these tools, but you are worried about creating new problems. Here are some concerns you may recognise:

* Are we falling behind on our competition in terms of **productivity**, and what will this mean for the **competative pressure** of the company? Are we spending our time corerctly in order to faster ship competative features.
* How do AI coding tools impact **security** and **IP control** risks? How can our developers use AI coding tools without risking the leaking of our codebase, secrets, critical IP code, or sensitive (customer) data to third-party services?
* How will team morale be affected, if the use of AI tools is restricted? The developers will known the AI tools exist and will feel restricted if they cannot use them or worse, use them anyway in a hidden adhoc manner.
* Are we still building a quality code base which is maintainable, testable, and understood by the team? Will the generated code meet the standards or is it introducing technical debt, I am not aware of?
* Are my junior devs still learning coding skills or are they leaning to heavily on prompt engineering? Will my teams skills degrade over time?
* How do I justify investment in AI coding tools? How do I calculate the ROI and how do I measure it?
* Who owns the AI coding tool rollout? Do we need new policies, and code review processes, or training?

The tension is really between "we need to do this" and "how do we do this responsibly without creating new problems."
